This is Gary Senderson,
Yeah, everyone knows me by that name—even in real life, a few people call me Gary because I’ve used this name almost everywhere.

Now let's talk about Xanthorox AI.

# 🧠 Idea of Xanthorox
Back in the era of WormGPT in 2021, it was a big hype. So, from a seller, I got my hands on WormGPT. It was a Python file with an LLM—total size of the folder was around 2GB. It was pretty good at first, but later on I realized it was just a kid’s toy.

What can someone possibly do with a 2GB model file?
Exactly—nothing, because the model parameters were so low it was useless in almost all use cases, even writing paragraphs.

That’s it.

Later, I found out people were selling WormGPT as a chatbot, and in the backend, it was just ChatGPT with a jailbreak. I got so frustrated with these scams—people were literally paying for cloud and external AI without knowing anything.

Putting that aside, I continued my hacking journey. Nothing special.

In 2025, I saw on the internet that AI was hyping again—very, very strong. So, I thought this might be good as a hobby. Then I started building small codebases, small models for translation, playing with LLaMA, fine-tuning it, etc.

Everything was good, but the problem was the knowledge and the hardware I had.

So, I saved up some money and bought some graphics cards (can’t mention the name or VRAM amount, but it was quite a lot). Then I started playing around with making datasets—my custom datasets from plain text.

Imagine turning a malware source code into a trainable dataset format—
Yeah, with AI, I was able to do that.

I then wrote a Python script to automate this process, made a few models for testing. And yes, obviously it took a huge amount of time because running it on a home server with limited GPU power was hard. But eventually, it worked.

So I kept doing it—
Finding malware sources, making datasets, training them.

That’s it.
My goal was to make an AI with malware and hacking knowledge, and with no restrictions.

# ⚙️ Idea Behind Modular Design
While I was testing the first Xanthorox v4 release—
Yes, it was good, but it wasn’t good at coding.
Another model was good at coding, but bad at reasoning.

Now, I wanted to merge them.
But merging would only make it use more GPU, which is bad.

So I made separate models for each task:

Xanthorox Coder for coding

Xanthorox Reasoner for reasoning

Now, as I’m writing this, I plan to add reasoning in all models,
Because without thinking like a human, you can’t build good code or do good tasks.

I’ll add a function to enable/disable it. No problem 😉

💰 Why So High Price?
The main challenge I face is graphics resources.

As I mentioned before, the only thing that makes me different is:
I host everything locally.

I bought a dedicated IP and very, very expensive GPUs just to stand out from the competition.
Because I know a lot of people are gonna copy me.

But something they can’t copy is giving their own server.
LOL.

I live in a poor country with poor laws,
So if I buy a server—no questions asked.
Whatever I do—no questions asked.
And I’m a professional, so security is top-notch.

# 📈 How Xanthorox Is Going Now
At first, within 4 months after the release, I made only 4 sales.

I sold it for $250 per month.
It was quite good, despite the fact that I made it just as a hobby.

Then I made an AI deepfake tool,
AI voice cloning software—
Sales weren’t that good.

So I began working on other AI tools.
But all of a sudden—sales began to start quick, like very quick.

I was kinda shocked.

Now I’m writing this article on 5/21/2025.
This month I already made $4,000, and last month I made $5,000.

Must be wondering how I made this much money?

I increased my price up to $300.
Now this is the fixed price I sell Xanthorox at—$300, that’s it.

I also sold some VIP packages—Xanthorox v5 Pro, which is very, very strong.
One of the flagship models—only Xen Package holders have access to it.

Can’t mention the exact number sold, but I can say it's $$$$
And it’s a yearly license.

# 📜 What Are the Rules After You Buy Xanthorox?
You cannot talk about Xanthorox with anyone

You cannot share any information about Xanthorox with anyone

All the things you make, all the things you do—you are responsible, not me

If you break any of these rules—your license will be banned immediately
